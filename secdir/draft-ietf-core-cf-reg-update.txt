1.  Introduction

   Section 12.3 of [RFC7252] describes the registration procedures for
   the "CoAP Content-Formats" IANA registry within the "Constrained
   RESTful Environments (CoRE) Parameters" registry group
   [IANA.core-parameters].  (Note that the columns of this registry have
   been revised according to [Err4954].)

   In particular, the text defines the rules for obtaining CoAP Content-
   Format identifiers from the "IETF Review" or "IESG Approval" range of
   the registry (256-9999) as well as from the First Come First Served
   (FCFS) range of the registry (10000-64999).  For the FCFS range,
   these rules do not involve the Designated Expert (DE) and are managed
   solely by IANA personnel to finalize the registration.

   Unfortunately, the instructions do not explicitly require checking
   that the combination of content-type (i.e., media type with optional
   parameters) and content coding associated with the requested CoAP
   Content-Format is semantically valid.  This task is generally non-
   trivial, requires knowledge from multiple documents and technologies,
   and should not be solely demanded from the registrar.  This lack of
   guidance may engender confusion in both the registering party and the
   registrar, and has already led to erroneous registrations.

   In Section 4.1, this document updates [RFC7252] by modifying the
   registration procedures for the "CoAP Content-Formats" registry to
   mitigate the risk of unintentional or malicious errors.  These
   updates amend the different ranges of the registry, introduce a
   review procedure to be performed for most ranges of the registry, and
   allow the registration of temporary Content-Format identifiers for
   certain ranges of the registry.  This document also introduces a new
   column, "Media Type", to the registry.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   This document uses the terms "media type", "content coding",
   "content-type", and "content format" as defined in Section 2 of
   [RFC9193].

3.  Examples for Erroneous Registrations

   This section provides examples of registration requests for the "CoAP
   Content-Formats" Registry (as defined in Section 12.3 of [RFC7252]
   and revised according to [Err4954]) that must be denied.  The
   checklist defined in Section 4.4 should prevent any of these attempts
   from succeeding.

   All the example registration requests will use a CoAP Content-Format
   with identifier 64999 in the FCFS range of the "CoAP Content-Formats"
   registry.

   For each of the following example registration requests, one can
   create a similar instance where the requested registration is for a
   CoAP Content-Format identifier within the "IETF Review" or "IESG
   Approval" range of the registry.  Similarly, such registrations must
   not be allowed to succeed.

3.1.  The Media Type is Unknown

   The registrant requests an FCFS Content-Format ID for an unknown
   media type:

   +==========================+================+=======+
   | Content Type             | Content Coding | ID    |
   +==========================+================+=======+
   | application/unknown+cbor | -              | 64999 |
   +--------------------------+----------------+-------+

       Table 1: Attempt at Registering Content-Format
                 for an Unknown Media Type

3.2.  The Media Type Parameter is Unknown

   The registrant requests an FCFS Content-Format ID for an existing
   media type with an unknown parameter:

   +======================================+================+=======+
   | Content Type                         | Content Coding | ID    |
   +======================================+================+=======+
   | application/cose;unknown-parameter=1 | -              | 64999 |
   +--------------------------------------+----------------+-------+

     Table 2: Attempt at Registering Content-Format for Media Type
                         with Unknown Parameter

3.3.  The Media Type Parameter Value is Invalid

   The registrant requests an FCFS Content-Format ID for an existing
   media type with an invalid parameter value:

   +====================================+================+=======+
   | Content Type                       | Content Coding | ID    |
   +====================================+================+=======+
   | application/cose;cose-type=invalid | -              | 64999 |
   +------------------------------------+----------------+-------+

       Table 3: Attempt at Registering Content-Format for Media
                  Type with Invalid Parameter Value

3.4.  The Content Coding is Unknown

   The registrant requests an FCFS Content-Format ID for an existing
   media type with an unknown content coding:

   +========================+================+=======+
   | Content Type           | Content Coding | ID    |
   +========================+================+=======+
   | application/senml+cbor | inflate        | 64999 |
   +------------------------+----------------+-------+

      Table 4: Attempt at Registering Content-Format
               with Unknown Content Coding

3.5.  Duplicate Entry with Default Media Type Parameters

   The registrant requests an FCFS Content-Format ID for a media type
   that includes a parameter set to its default value, while a
   (hypothetical) Content-Format ID 64900 is already registered for this
   media type without that parameter.  As a result, this could lead to
   the creation of two separate Content-Format IDs for the same
   "logical" entry.

   +==================================+================+=======+
   | Content Type                     | Content Coding | ID    |
   +==================================+================+=======+
   | application/my                   | -              | 64900 |
   +----------------------------------+----------------+-------+
   | application/my;parameter=default | -              | 64999 |
   +----------------------------------+----------------+-------+

       Table 5: Attempt at Registering an Equivalent Logical
            Entry with a Different Content-Format ID (1)

3.6.  Duplicate Entry with Default Content Coding

   The registrant requests an FCFS Content-Format ID for the "identity"
   Content Coding, which is the default coding.  If accepted, this
   request would duplicate an entry with (hypothetical) Content-Format
   ID 64900 where the "Content Coding" field is left empty.

   +================+================+=======+
   | Content Type   | Content Coding | ID    |
   +================+================+=======+
   | application/my | -              | 64900 |
   +----------------+----------------+-------+
   | application/my | identity       | 64999 |
   +----------------+----------------+-------+

        Table 6: Attempt at Registering an
         Equivalent Logical Entry with a
         Different Content-Format ID (2)

3.7.  Duplicate Entry with Equivalent Parameter

   The registrant requests an FCFS Content-Format ID for a media type
   that includes a parameter.  The value of this parameter appears
   distinct from that of a (hypothetical) previously registered Content-
   Format ID 64900 that also includes this parameter.  However, the
   semantics of the parameter value are identical to the existing
   registration.

   In this example, the eat_profile parameter value (which can be any
   URI) is set as a Uniform Resource Name (URN) [RFC8141].  Since for
   URNs, the Namespace Identifier (foo in the example) is defined as
   case insensitive, the two registrations are semantically identical.

   +=================================+================+=======+
   | Content Type                    | Content Coding | ID    |
   +=================================+================+=======+
   | application/                    | -              | 64900 |
   | eat+cwt;eat_profile="urn:foo:1" |                |       |
   +---------------------------------+----------------+-------+
   | application/                    | -              | 64999 |
   | eat+cwt;eat_profile="urn:FOO:1" |                |       |
   +---------------------------------+----------------+-------+

      Table 7: Attempt at Registering an Equivalent Logical
           Entry with a Different Content-Format ID (3)

4.  Updates to RFC 7252

   This section updates Section 12.3 of [RFC7252] and introduces four
   new “virtual” subsections, 12.3.1 to 12.3.4.

4.1.  Updates to Section 12.3 "CoAP Content-Formats Registry"

       Table 8: Updated CoAP Content-Formats Registration Procedures

   The 256-9999 range now has registration procedures requiring "IETF
   Review with Expert Review" or "IESG Approval with Expert Review."  In
   particular:

   *  All assignments according to "IETF Review with Expert Review" are
      made on an "IETF Review" basis per Section 4.8 of [BCP26] with
      "Expert Review" additionally required per Section 4.5 of [BCP26].

      The procedure for early IANA allocation of "standards track code
      points" defined in [RFC7120] also applies.  When such a procedure
      is used, IANA will ask the Designated Expert(s) to approve the
      early allocation before registration.  In addition, working group
      chairs are encouraged to consult the Expert(s) early during the
      process outlined in Section 3.1 of [RFC7120].

   *  All assignments according to "IESG Approval with Expert Review"
      are made on an "IESG Approval" basis per Section 4.10 of [BCP26]
      with "Expert Review" additionally required per Section 4.5 of
      [BCP26].

   The 10000-64999 range now has two separate registration procedures.
   If the registration consists solely of a registered media type name
   in the "Content Type" field, without any parameter names or "Content
   Coding", and the media type has not yet been used in this registry,
   then the policy is FCFS, as before.  In all other cases, the policy
   is "Expert Review," following the procedure described in Section 4.4.

   A new column with the title "Notes" has been added to the CoAP
   Content-Formats Registration Procedures shown in Table 8.

4.2.  New Section 12.3.1 "Temporary Content-Format Registrations"

   This section clarifies that the "CoAP Content-Formats" registry
   allows temporary registrations within the 0-255 and 256-9999 ranges.
   The range 10000-64999 does not allow temporary registrations.

   A temporary registration may be created for example by an IANA early
   allocation action, as requested by the authors of an Internet-Draft
   in the IETF stream.  Alternatively, it may be created because the
   referenced media type is still provisional (that is, included in the
   IANA "Provisional Standard Media Type" registry
   [IANA.provisional-standard-media-types]).

   A temporary registration is marked by IANA with the label "TEMPORARY"
   in the corresponding registry entry.  Once the required review
   procedure for the temporary ID has successfully completed, and the
   referenced media type is included in the IANA Media Types registry
   [IANA.media-types], IANA must remove the "TEMPORARY" label so that
   the entry becomes permanent.  If the requested temporary entry does
   not successfully pass its required review procedure, IANA must remove
   the entry again and set the Content-Format ID value back to
   "Unassigned".  This may happen for example when an Internet-Draft
   requesting a Content-Format ID is abandoned, or when the referenced
   provisional media type is abandoned.

4.3.  New Section 12.3.2 "Adding the Media Type Column to the Registry"

   To assist users of the "CoAP Content-Formats" registry in finding
   detailed information about the media type associated with each CoAP
   Content-Format, and to ensure that a media type exists before a new
   entry can be registered, IANA is requested to add a new column "Media
   Type" to the registry.  This new column is placed directly to the
   right of the existing "Content Type" column.

   The "Media Type" field for each entry lists the (base) media type
   name and provides a hyperlink to registration information for that
   media type as recorded by IANA.  If the media type is provisional,
   the hyperlink points to the IANA "Provisional Standard Media Type"
   registry [IANA.provisional-standard-media-types].  If a provisional
   media type is later abandoned or becomes a permanent media type, IANA
   must update the "Media Type" field in the associated entries.  In the
   case of abandonment, this field should be left empty.  If the media
   type becomes permanent, the field should include a hyperlink to the
   registration information for that media type.

   Note that the registration request procedure remains unchanged.  A
   requester does not need to fill out the "Media Type" field
   separately, as the necessary information is already provided in the
   "Content Type" field of the request.

4.4.  New Section 12.3.3 "Expert Review Procedure"

   The Designated Expert (DE) is instructed to perform the Expert
   Review, as described by the following checklist:

   1.  The combination of content-type and content coding for which the
       registration is requested must not be already present in the
       "CoAP Content-Formats" registry;

   2.  The media type associated with the requested Content-Format must
       either be registered in the "Media Types" registry
       [IANA.media-types] or approved for registration.  Alternatively,
       it may be listed in the "Provisional Standard Media Type"
       registry [IANA.provisional-standard-media-types].  The use of
       provisional standard media types is only permitted for Content-
       Format identifiers within the ranges of 0-255 and 256-9999;

   3.  The optional parameter names must have been defined in
       association with the media type, and any parameter values
       associated with such parameter names must be as permitted;

   4.  The Content Type must be in the preferred format defined in
       Section 4.5;

   5.  If a Content Coding is specified, it must exist (or must have
       been approved for registration) in the "HTTP Content Coding"
       registry of the "Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Parameters"
       [IANA.http-parameters].

   For the 0-255 range, in addition to the checks described above, the
   DE is instructed to also evaluate the requested codepoint concerning
   the limited availability of the 1-byte codepoint space.  For the
   256-9999 range and the 10000-64999 range, a similar criterion may
   also apply where combinations of media type parameters and content
   coding choices consume considerable codepoint space.

4.5.  New Section 12.3.4 "Preferred Format for the Content Type Field"

   This section defines the preferred string format for including a
   requested Content Type into the "CoAP Content-Formats" registry.
   During the review process, the Designated Expert(s) or IANA may
   rewrite a requested Content Type into this preferred string format
   before approval.

   The preferred string format is as defined in Section 8.3.1 of
   [RFC9110] and follows these rules:

   1.  For any case-insensitive elements, lowercase characters are used.

   2.  Parameter values are only quoted if the value is such that it
       requires use of quoted-string per Section 5.6.6 of [RFC9110].
       Otherwise, a parameter value is included unquoted.

   3.  A single semicolon character without any adjacent whitespace
       characters is used as the separator between media type and
       parameters.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document hardens the registration procedures of CoAP Content-
   Formats in ways that reduce the chances of malicious manipulation of
   the associated registry.

   Other than that, it does not change the Security Considerations of
   [RFC7252].

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document updates the IANA procedures defined in [RFC7252] for

      Type and parameters is checked prior to assignment."

   document is approved for publication.  RFC-Editor: please remove this
   section once the note has been removed.
