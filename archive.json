The term \"subregistry\" should be reserved for registries that are nested within specific registrations. For example, at https://www.iana.org/assignments/isis-tlv-codepoints, \"IS-IS Sub-TLVs for Reverse Metric TLV\" is a subregistry for value 16 (\"Reverse Metric\") in the \"IS-IS Top-Level TLV Codepoints\" registry.\r\n> \r\n> Registry group\r\n> A set of registries presented as a single document through a common URL (i.e. https://iana.org/assignments/*) is called a \"registry group.\" A group consists of one or more registries. Registries are typically grouped when they are thematically related, such as when implementers are likely to use the different identifier types for a common protocol.\r\n> \r\n> In the past, these groups have been called \"top-level registries\" or \"registries\" (which we have now settled on as the descriptor for a discrete set of registrations, as above). [RFC 8126](https://www.iana.org/go/rfc8126) uses the term \"registry grouping,\" but the RFC Editor recommended the more flexible \"group.\"",

Essentially, any well-formed request is\r\n    accepted.\r\n \r\nWhat you are implicitly doing is re-defining a policy that is in practice Expert Review.

Maybe that could look something like this:\"_\r\n\r\n> Range | Registration Procedures | Note\r\n> --|--|--\r\n> 10000-64999 (no parameters or content coding) | FCFS | Corresponding media type registration required\r\n> 10000-64999 (includes parameters and/or content coding) | Expert Review | Lightweight review described in RFC XXXX, Section 5.2.1",

The only difference is that 0-255 requires the DE to judge the potential popularity of the requested C-F in constrained protocols, whilst 10000-64999 doesn't.\r\n\r\nIs that worth introducing new semantics?  (Also, would we need to \"Update: 8126\" if we do that?)\r\n\r\nWe have a bug in our registration procedures, which has already been abused and can be abused again until we fix it.  If we bundle the fix with the wider IANAbis discussion, we risk delaying an urgent action.\r\n\r\n",
