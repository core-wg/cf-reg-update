The term \"subregistry\" should be reserved for registries that are nested within specific registrations. For example, at https://www.iana.org/assignments/isis-tlv-codepoints, \"IS-IS Sub-TLVs for Reverse Metric TLV\" is a subregistry for value 16 (\"Reverse Metric\") in the \"IS-IS Top-Level TLV Codepoints\" registry.\r\n> \r\n> Registry group\r\n> A set of registries presented as a single document through a common URL (i.e. https://iana.org/assignments/*) is called a \"registry group.\" A group consists of one or more registries. Registries are typically grouped when they are thematically related, such as when implementers are likely to use the different identifier types for a common protocol.\r\n> \r\n> In the past, these groups have been called \"top-level registries\" or \"registries\" (which we have now settled on as the descriptor for a discrete set of registrations, as above). [RFC 8126](https://www.iana.org/go/rfc8126) uses the term \"registry grouping,\" but the RFC Editor recommended the more flexible \"group.\"",

In addition, new procedures are added\nin Sections 5.1 and 5.2, but those should be new 12.3 subsections in RFC 7252.\n\nI suggest to have a dedicated \"Updates to RFC 7252\" section, where the text in\nSections 5.1 and Sections 5.2 are also added as new Sections 12.3.1 and\nSections 12.3.2 to RFC 7252.\n\nFor example:\n\n----\n\n4. Updates to RFC 7252\n\nThis Section updates Section 12.3, and adds the new Sections 12.3.1 and 12.3.2,\nto [RFC7252].\n\n4.1. Updates to Section 12.3\n\n// The text in Section 5\n\n4.2. New Section 12.3.1\n\n// The text in Section 5.1\n\n4.2. New Section 12.3.2\n\n// The text in Section 5.2\n\n----\n\nThe Security Considerations then become Section 5. The IANA Considerations\nbecome Section 6, and there you only need to state something like:\n\n\"This document updates the IANA procedures of [RFC7252] for registering CoAP\nContent-Formats.\"\n```",

The only difference is that 0-255 requires the DE to judge the potential popularity of the requested C-F in constrained protocols, whilst 10000-64999 doesn't.\r\n\r\nIs that worth introducing new semantics?

It would be more like \"the range 10000-64999 when the FCFS policy is applied\"   which is rather long as a term. \r\n\r\n\"FCFS scope\"  or  \"FCFS portion\" could also work to refer to this new situation.",
