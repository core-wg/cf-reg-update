The term \"subregistry\" should be reserved for registries that are nested within specific registrations. For example, at https://www.iana.org/assignments/isis-tlv-codepoints, \"IS-IS Sub-TLVs for Reverse Metric TLV\" is a subregistry for value 16 (\"Reverse Metric\") in the \"IS-IS Top-Level TLV Codepoints\" registry.\r\n> \r\n> Registry group\r\n> A set of registries presented as a single document through a common URL (i.e. https://iana.org/assignments/*) is called a \"registry group.\" A group consists of one or more registries. Registries are typically grouped when they are thematically related, such as when implementers are likely to use the different identifier types for a common protocol.\r\n> \r\n> In the past, these groups have been called \"top-level registries\" or \"registries\" (which we have now settled on as the descriptor for a discrete set of registrations, as above). [RFC 8126](https://www.iana.org/go/rfc8126) uses the term \"registry grouping,\" but the RFC Editor recommended the more flexible \"group.\"",

In addition, new procedures are added\nin Sections 5.1 and 5.2, but those should be new 12.3 subsections in RFC 7252.\n\nI suggest to have a dedicated \"Updates to RFC 7252\" section, where the text in\nSections 5.1 and Sections 5.2 are also added as new Sections 12.3.1 and\nSections 12.3.2 to RFC 7252.\n\nFor example:\n\n----\n\n4. Updates to RFC 7252\n\nThis Section updates Section 12.3, and adds the new Sections 12.3.1 and 12.3.2,\nto [RFC7252].\n\n4.1. Updates to Section 12.3\n\n// The text in Section 5\n\n4.2. New Section 12.3.1\n\n// The text in Section 5.1\n\n4.2. New Section 12.3.2\n\n// The text in Section 5.2\n\n----\n\nThe Security Considerations then become Section 5.

Is that right?\n\nIf so, this contradicts with our statement that we can't have temporary entries in the range 10000-64999.\n\nThis rule was (I think) added by me because of the following reason:\n* if a registration is made in 10000-64999 pointing to a draft-v01 as the reference, and then the draft expires and is eventually abandoned, we still want the registration entry to stay.  Since the media type that the CF I-D is pointing to is still equally valid and the draft-v01 reference will still exist \"forever\" in the database.\n* this is similar to making a registration by email or so.\n\nThe above first bullet can have a clash / confusion w.r.t. the text in our draft at end of 4.2:\n\n> This may happen for example **when an Internet-Draft requesting a Content-Format ID is abandoned**, or when the referenced provisional media type is abandoned.\n\nThe first part in **bold** is only applicable in the Expert/IETF ranges, but not in 10000-64999.\nTo avoid potential confusion around this, it was simply said that temporary doesn't exist in 10000-64999. If we do allow it there, there could be a mistake by IANA that it removes entries in this range based on expired drafts.",

(This is for the sake of constructive argument, Thomas/Authors do not read any harm in my words:) If the RFC7252 is read-only, how is it that we are updating it? \"This section updates Section 12.3 of [RFC7252]\" , so having said that we are indeed updating that section, we can add and remove things, and we are effectively adding text and subsections (subsections are part of the section, or you consider the subsection and its title as metadata? maybe that is why all this). In other words, I would not be shocked to say that we introduce new subsections within the Section 12.3 modifications. To be honest, before your comment I had not thought about the ToC (or a virtual ToC) of RFC7252. We could eventually say that our modifications also \u00a0update the ToC of RFC7252. What would happen if the section we are modifying had other subsections that now we are not including? For me it is a non-issue to think about the ToC of the original document. For the sake of openness, I think that even with the word \"virtual\" the reader understands \u00a0that we have new content for the Section 12.3 of RFC7252 (the title remains the same) and within the new content we have new subsections. So in the end the message passes, but to be honest I had no Idea why the new subsections were \"virtual\" (however, the content of the subsections is not virtual but \"real\"?) when I first read the document.  Anyway I think too much ink was spent for just one word. I can live on even if you decide to keep the phrase as it as it is , you can close the issue/s no problem from my side.",

Or better, what is the definition of an \"invalid request\"? (In theory we do not have a definition, is ehe Expert Review that will determine if its invalid or not) In particular, 3.1 to 3.4, all are examples of something \"invalid\" or \"unknown\"... but how do you know that something is \"invalid\" or \"unknown\"? This is not hinted in the text.  My whole comment was to simply clarify to the reader that the only way to know if foo is unvalid or unknown is to dig into other RFCs (that may or may not be linked in the Registry). My whole comment because I was asking myself.. \"how do you check if foo is invalid/unknown?\" then I started digging. But maybe it is only me , and if its clear for all the people that already read this. No problem!",

One remaining comment/question is that the current IANA registry policy description is more clear as it spells out \"First Come First Served\".\r\n\r\nTrue that.\r\n\r\nAs a side note, after writing everything down, I'm beginning to think that the difference between \"Expert Review (full)\" and \"Expert Review (Expert Check: FCFS+),\" as suggested by @cabo, may not be significant enough to warrant different terms.\r\n\r\nAll the checks would equally apply to both ranges.  The only difference is that 0-255 requires the DE to judge the potential popularity of the requested C-F in constrained protocols, whilst 10000-64999 doesn't.\r\n\r\nIs that worth introducing new semantics?  (Also, would we need to \"Update: 8126\" if we do that?)\r\n\r\nWe have a bug in our registration procedures, which has already been abused and can be abused again until we fix it.  If we bundle the fix with the wider IANAbis discussion, we risk delaying an urgent action.\r\n\r\n",

It would be more like \"the range 10000-64999 when the FCFS policy is applied\"   which is rather long as a term. \r\n\r\n\"FCFS scope\"  or  \"FCFS portion\" could also work to refer to this new situation.",
